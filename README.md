# Instagram Scraper <b> [NodeJS] </b>

This is a web application designed to get profile data from a public/business/creator instagram account or any hashtag and download the images regarding the same on your pc.


## Challenges

* Finding an Api that works for all public accounts which was not possible by using the official Instagram-graph-api.
* Figuring a way to bypass CORS policy of instagram which won't let you show the image url obtained from the api.
* I had to race against time because this was one of the problem statements for a solo developer backend competition.
* Integrating python to nodejs backend to prevent detection. <br>

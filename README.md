# Instagram Scraper <b> [NodeJS] </b>

This is a web application designed to get profile data from a public/business/creator instagram account or any hashtag and download the images regarding the same on your pc.

This application was my submission for the Backend web-developer competition at Sheryians Coding School. <br>
which won me The Champions Tropy - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abhyuday911_sheryianscodingschool-webdevelopment-backendcompetition-activity-7020302321519632384-3Ky9?utm_source=li_share&utm_content=feedcontent&utm_medium=g_dt_web&utm_campaign=copy"> https://www.linkedin.com/post </a>


## Challenges

* Finding an Api that works for all public accounts which was not possible by using the official Instagram-graph-api.
* Figuring a way to bypass CORS policy of instagram which won't let you show the image url obtained from the api.
* I had to race against time because this was one of the problem statements for a solo developer backend competition.
* Integrating python to nodejs backend to prevent detection. <br>

# Instagram Scraper

this is a web application designed to get profile data from a public/business/creator instagram account or any hashtag and download the images regarding the same on your pc


## Challenges

* Finding an Api that works for all public accounts which was not possible by using the official Instagram-graph-api
* Finding a way to bypass CORS policy of instagram which won't let you show the image url obtained from the api
* I had to race against time because this was one of the problem statements for a solo developer backend competition.
